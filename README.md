# Alogorithms for Linear Algebra and Matrixes

## Description

This application contains, a set of examples for all mayor linear algebraic algorithms. Within the source code there are definitions and complex descriptions to the different aspects of computing bidimentional arrays.

This executable is been programmed entirely using both a <b>GCC</b> product, and the <b>GCC</b> compiler that are distributed under a GPL licence. The source code of Keyboard Math 75 is based of a GCC product, more especificaly their distribution of the <b> C language</b>.

## Algorithms

| Algorithm           | Usage         | Time Complexity   |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
